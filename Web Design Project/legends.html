                <h2>Frank Lampard</h2>
                <p>What more can be said about Super Frank Lampard that hasn't already been said. The top scoring midfielder of all time, top scorer in Chelsea history, 2nd only to the G.O.A.T Ronaldinho in the Balon D'or, won every trophy possible with Chelsea. 648 games, 211 goals, 145 assists, 16 trophies. The man is more than just a Chelsea legend, he is a football legend. <br><br> Lampard was capable of scoring from just about anywhere on the pitch. Up close, outside the box, set-piece. Left foot, right foot, head. He could pick pass as good as the best of them. He worked harder than anyone, and he was always available. He could play anywhere from deep lying midfielder all the way to secondary striker.<br><br>He was always there when you needed him, scoring a brace to win Chelsea's first ever Premier League title. Equalising in the Champions League final 2008. Scoring from range against Everton in the FA Cup final to win the game. Lampard is arguably the most important player in Chelsea history.

                <h2>Didier Drogba</h2>
                <p>Didier Drogba is Chelsea's best striker in the last 30 years. The man was made for the big occasion, scoring 12 goals in 17 finals. He is the ultimate big game player. No Chelsea fan will ever forget Drogba's equaliser in the 2012 Champions League Final in Munich or his penalty kick which won Chelsea their first ever Champions League title.<br><br> Drogba was not just a big game player, but an all round world class striker. He was fast, strong, lethal in the air, clinical with either foot, incredible hold-up play, and a great creator. In 381 games, Drogba scored 164 goals and assisted 86 times. He won 15 trophies with Chelsea and is almost always mentioned when discussing the best Premier League strikers of all time.</p>

                <h2>Eden Hazard</h2>
                <p>Eden Hazard spent his prime years tearing up the Premier League with Chelsea. The electric winger and his unpredictable style of play was a sight to behold for supporters and a nightmare to defend for oppositions. While Hazard did not collect the tally of trophies that Lampard and Drogba did, he is acreddited with single-handedly carrying Chelsea's attack for his entire Chelsea career, barr the one season that shall never be mentioned. This is further proven by the absolute lack of goalscorers since his departure to Real Madrid, with only one player, Tammy Abraham, scoring double digit league goals since Hazard left in 2019.<br><br> Hazard was incredibly fast and agile, making him a nightmare to defend when on the ball. His close control and low centre of gravity made him impossible to dispossess. He could create and score, often carrying the responsibility for both. While players like Lampard and Drogba were massive and important players, none could lift you off your seat the way Hazard could. His ability to take players on and cruise through opposition midfield and defense in the blink of an eye frequently had Stamford Bridge rocking. A great example of this is goal against Arsenal in 2017, when he runs the entire half of the pitch, shrugging off Coquelin as he goes, turning Koscielni inside out before lifting the ball over Petr Cech's foot to make it 2-0 Chelsea.<br><br>Hazard scored 110 goals and assisted 92 times in 352 games for Chelsea. Hazard won 6 trophies in that time, winning his Final game 4-2 against Arsenal in the Europa League final, scoring 2 and assisting 1.
