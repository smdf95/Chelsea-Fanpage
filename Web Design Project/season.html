                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p>In the midst of a chaotic and senseless transfer window, led by new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly, Chelsea began the season well with a win against Everton. Any feeling of optimism among Chelsea supporters was quickly and abruptly cut short, with poor results bringing Thomas Tuchel’s reign as Chelsea manager to an untimely end.<br><br> This decision was met with much backlash from Chelsea supporters, as the decision was made by Boehly without a technical director in place. Boehly, with no experience in football, decided to sack Tuchel and appoint a mid-table and largely unproven manager in Graham Potter. Only after this did Boehly decide to appoint a technical director, someone who could have helped Chelsea avoid such a terrible decision.<br><br> However, Potter’s reign as Chelsea manager started strong, with Chelsea looking as if they had turned a new leaf, winning 5 games on the trot, and convincingly too. However, this good run of form would meet its end right before the commencement of the World Cup 2022, with Chelsea losing 3 games in a row, without registering a single goal in that time. <br>

                    <h2>The Middle</h2>
                    <p>Any sense of accomplishment and righteousness that Boehly must have felt from appointing Potter was brought to a painful end as we entered the new year. Though Chelsea returned from the World Cup with a win against relegation candidates Bournemouth, they would go on to record only one win throughout January, scoring only twice in that time. Chelsea fans must have thought this was as bad as it could get, that the club was at rock bottom. Unfortunately for Chelsea fans, things would only get worse in February.<br><br> Chelsea ended February with no wins, two draws, and three losses. They only managed to score once across five games. Three of the opposition that Chelsea faced in February were relegation candidates. Chelsea had broken the January transfer window record spend by some distance, signing 6 new players and failing to address the biggest issue in the squad, which was the absence of an out and out striker. The club that spent over half a billion pounds on players couldn’t even manage to win against the teams at the bottom of the table. Chelsea were the laughing stock of the league and European football in general. <br><br>  Potter might have thought he had turned a corner in the beginning of March, recording three wins on the bounce, including a vital 2-0 win against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League RO16, which sent Chelsea to the Quarter Finals. However, Chelsea would be embarrassed by Everton and Aston Villa in the coming games, forcing the board to accept defeat and sack Graham Potter.

                    <h2>The End</h2>
                    <p>Potter’s sacking was met with a sense of relief among Chelsea fans. Potter’s assistant manager, Bruno Saltor, took the lead for Chelsea’s match against Liverpool, which ended in a massively underwhelming 0-0 draw. In the next days, Chelsea appointed Club Legend and former manager Frank Lampard as interim manager for the remainder of the season, while the board continued their thorough search for a long-term manager. This decision was met with a mostly positive reaction among Chelsea supporters. Fans did not expect Lampard to fix the issues in the squad, but they did expect Lampard to inject a bit of passion into the team, something that Graham Potter severely lacked. <br><br> Unfortunately, if Chelsea fans thought Potter’s Chelsea were hard to watch, they were in for a rough few months, as Lampard’s Chelsea struggled to keep possession of the ball, much less create a chance. This was a common theme throughout Lampard's first 18 month tenure at Chelsea, and more so in his short stint at Everton too. Chelsea bowed out of the Champions League after an embarrassing 4-0 loss to Madrid across two legs. </p>
